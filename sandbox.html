<p>The City of Vancouver provides information about PFAS sampling results to enable drinking water customers to stay informed. Visit <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/learn-about-pfas">Learn about PFAS</a> for more information about actions the City is taking to keep your water safe and for steps you can take at home.</p>

<h2>Washington State Department of Health PFAS State Action Levels</h2>

<p>In 2022, the Washington State Department of Health established State Action Levels for five PFAS that set testing and notification requirements for some water providers, including Vancouver starting in 2023. State Action Levels are set to protect human health and based on the best available science at the time. PFAS chemicals are still being researched and health advice is updated as new science becomes available. State Action Levels are public health goals to protect all people, including sensitive groups and life stages, from potential harmful effects of drinking water with PFAS over a lifetime.</p>

<p>If you have been drinking water over the State Action Level, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you will get sick or have health problems from this exposure.</p>

<h2>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Proposed PFAS Maximum Contaminant Level</h2>

<p>In 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for six PFAS. The proposed rule does not require any action until finalized, but if approved would set enforceable levels of PFAS in drinking water and require public water systems to monitor for these PFAS, notify the public of the levels of these PFAS, and reduce the levels of these PFAS in drinking water if they exceed the proposed standards.</p>

<h2>City of Vancouver PFAS Test Results</h2>

<p><strong>Sampling Dates Shown Here: March 1, 2023 </strong></p>

<p>Below are the sampling results from the City&rsquo;s water stations. Vancouver has an open system in which water can be transferred from almost any water station to different areas of the City. We are adjusting our operations and prioritizing use of sources with lower levels of PFAS. However, due to the prevalence of PFAS in local groundwater, water rights limitations and operational restrictions, we are unable to turn off all PFAS sources that exceed State Action Levels without impacting supply.</p>

<p><em>Note: ND = non detect; ppt = parts per trillion (1 ppt is equivalent to a single drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools)</em></p>
