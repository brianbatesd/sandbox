<h2>Volunteer at Behrens Woods</h2>

<p>Join City staff and volunteers from the Naturespaces Program on Saturday, February 11 from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. for a morning of pulling English Ivy in Behrens Woods Urban Nature Area, with a focus on removing ivy from on and around trees to minimize impacts to forest health. Behrens Woods is a fairly healthy site in the City, and continuing to control English Ivy on site will support the plant understory continue to thrive and provide vital habitat and ecosystem services.</p>

<p>Event will happen rain or shine! Training, gloves and tools, and snacks will be provided. Ivy pulling will take place primarily off of established trails, and the terrain will be uneven and slightly sloped. Activities can include cutting ivy off of tree trunks, bending over to pull ivy free from the soil, and shoveling and spreading bark mulch.</p>

<p>What is English Ivy, and why are we removing it? English Ivy is a Class C unregulated weed in most of Washington State, meaning that the presence on the landscape is low priority for the state given its widespread establishment. That&rsquo;s where our mighty efforts come into play! Pulling the juvenile vines is key in mitigating the continued impacts non native plants have on the native plant community.
