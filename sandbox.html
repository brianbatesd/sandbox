<h2>5 Things to Know About PFAS and Your Drinking Water</h2>

<p><strong>Providing our customers safe water and protecting public health is the City&rsquo;s top priority.</strong>&nbsp;Water is critical to the livability and vitality of our community.</p>

<p><strong>1. The City is taking action now to address an emerging issue with PFAS</strong>&mdash;a group of human-made chemicals that have the potential to adversely affect human health and the environment. In late 2020, the City completed proactive testing that found PFAS at very low levels in some of the City&rsquo;s groundwater wells. Actions the City is taking to protect and maintain water quality include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Evaluating treatment options:</em></strong> Water quality engineers are evaluating cost-effective treatment options to remove PFAS from the water</li>
	<li><strong><em>Finding long-term solutions:</em></strong> Expert scientists are determining potential sources of PFAS and the extent of PFAS in the local groundwater.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Planning for the future:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Future costs for PFAS treatment are included in the City&rsquo;s long-range capital plan.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Reducing costs:</em></strong> The City is pursuing federal and state grants and loans to reduce the impact to ratepayers.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Sharing information:</strong> </em><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/pfas-sampling-results">Information on PFAS and test results</a> are posted on the City&rsquo;s website and reported in the <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/water-quality-reports">Annual Water Quality Report</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>PFAS (per and polyfluoroalkyl substances) have been manufactured and used worldwide since the 1950s</strong> in food packaging, non-stick cookware, clothing, furniture, firefighting foam, and many other commercial household and workplace products. The presence of PFAS chemicals is widespread because they do not break down easily in the natural environment.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;What is the source of PFAS in the City&rsquo;s drinking water?&nbsp;</strong>There is currently no apparent or known source for PFAS in the City&#39;s water supply. PFAS are widespread in the environment throughout the country and the world. Typically, PFAS can be found most predominately at military bases, manufacturing plants, and airfields that use PFAS. These types of locations historically used products with PFAS. The City has hired expert water quality engineers and scientists to conduct a study to better understand possible sources and concentration of the PFAS in the City&#39;s groundwater supply. The City is also identifying treatment technologies that can be used to remove PFAS and working to estimate the cost to design, build and operate them.&nbsp;The City will continue to update this webpage as more is learned. </p>

<p><strong>4. The levels of PFAS found in Vancouver&#39;s water are low, yet above the Washington State Department of Health&#39;s adopted State Action Levels. </strong>State Action Levels for PFAS represent a conservative level at which no adverse effects are expected over a lifetime of drinking the water, even in health-sensitive populations.<strong> If you have been drinking water with PFAS above a State Action Level, Washington State Department of Health says it does not mean you will get sick or have health problems. </strong></p>

<p><strong>5. The low levels of PFAS found in Vancouver&#39;s water are also above the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) Health Advisories Levels issued in June 2022. </strong>EPA created the health advisories to protect all people, including sensitive populations and life stages, from adverse health effects resulting from a lifetime of exposure to these PFAS in drinking water.<strong> </strong>They also consider other potential sources of exposure to PFAS beyond drinking water (for example, food, air, consumer products, etc.), which provides an additional layer of protection.</p>

<h3><a name="What are PFAS">What are PFAS, and why is there a concern?</a></h3>

<p>PFAS (per and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a large group of human-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. PFAS have been manufactured and used in food packaging, non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and many other commercial household and workplace products. Some PFAS can build up in the bodies of humans and animals. In scientific tests, PFAS have been shown to affect the health of animals when they are present at elevated levels.</p>

<h3><a name="health concerns">What are the health concerns with PFAS?</a></h3>

<p>The Washington State Department of Health reports scientists are still studying how PFAS affect people&rsquo;s health. There is a lot we do not yet know, though much research by the EPA and other scientists is underway to better understand the impacts. PFAS are present in many everyday household materials including non-stick cookware, food packaging, clothing and furniture. Minimizing exposure to PFAS will require ongoing reductions of sources of PFAS in our daily environment.&nbsp;Below are some resources where you can learn more:</p>

<h3><a id="Are PFAS regulated?" name="Are PFAS regulated?">Are PFAS regulated?</a></h3>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency:</strong><br />
PFAS are not yet regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA has developed and updated Health Advisory Levels for PFAS and is developing a National Drinking Water Regulation. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>In 2016, the EPA established a lifetime Health Advisory Level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for two PFAS (PFOA and PFOS), combined in drinking water</strong>. To better describe parts per trillion (ppt), an analogy frequently used is that of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. One part per trillion is like one drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.<br />
	A Health Advisory is not enforceable like regulations. Instead, the advisories are interim guidance before EPA develops a formal regulation. The Health Advisory Level is the minimum concentration of a compound which may present health risks to an individual over a lifetime of exposure</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos"><strong>In June 2022</strong></a><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos">,<strong> EPA set new interim health advisories for PFOA at 0.004 ppt and PFOS at 0.02 ppt</strong> based on new data and draft analyses that show levels at which negative health effects could occur are lower than previously understood</a>. They consider other potential sources of exposure to PFAS beyond drinking water (for example, food, air, consumer products, etc.), which provides an additional layer of protection. These new health advisories for PFOA and PFOS are below current reliable detection abilities of scientific equipment (Scientists can currently detect PFAS compounds at 2 ppt.)<br />
	EPA also set final Health Advisory Levels for two additional types of PFAS: GenX chemicals and PFBS. EPA&#39;s health advisories are non-enforceable and non-regulatory. See EPA&rsquo;s Questions and Answers: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/questions-and-answers-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-pfos-genx-chemicals-and-pfbs">Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA, PFOS, GenX Chemicals, and PFBS</a> for more information. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>EPA is developing a proposed National Drinking Water Regulation for publication by the end of 2022 for PFOA and PFOS</strong>. <strong>EPA anticipates finalizing the rule by the end of 2023.</strong> The proposal will include both a non-enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) and an enforceable standard, or Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) or Treatment Technique. The MCLG is the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur, allowing an adequate margin of safety. The enforceable standard is set as close as feasible to MCLG. EPA considers the ability to measure and treat a contaminant as well as costs and benefits in setting the enforceable standard.

<p><strong>Washington State Board of Health</strong><br />
The Washington State Board of Health completed rulemaking that <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/DrinkingWater/RegulationandCompliance/RuleMaking">sets State Action Levels for five PFAS, with sampling requirements for some utilities starting in 2023</a>. </p>

<h3><a id="What is a State Action Level?" name="What is a State Action Level?">What is a State Action Level?</a></h3>

<p>Washington State Department of Health&rsquo;s toxicologists developed State Action Levels to protect humans, including sensitive groups, from harmful health effects of drinking water with PFAS in the long-term. The Department of Health reports: </p>

<ul>
	<li>State Action Levels are levels of chemicals that we set for long-term daily drinking water to protect people&#39;s health.</li>
	<li>The PFAS State Action Levels are set well below levels that caused health effects in animal studies.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you have been drinking water with PFAS above a State Action Level, it does not mean you will get sick or have health problems.</li>
	<li>We do not have enough information to recommend State Action Levels for every type of PFAS that may be in drinking water.</li>
	<li>When applicable, we recommend removal technologies effective on a wide variety of PFAS.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="What is an EPA Health Advisory?" name="What is an EPA Health Advisory?">What is an EPA Health Advisory?</a></h3>

<p>The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to issue Health Advisories for contaminants that are not subject to National Primary Drinking Water Regulation. Health advisories are not enforceable like regulations. Instead, the advisories are interim guidance before EPA develops a formal regulation.&nbsp;Click to learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/questions-and-answers-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-pfos-genx-chemicals-and-pfbs#q4">EPA&rsquo;s lifetime health advisories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="How long has the city had PFAS in the groundwater supply?">Has the City tested for PFAS in its wells?</a></h3>

<p>Yes. The City has been actively seeking to learn and understand potential PFAS impacts to our groundwater resources. Here is a brief history of the City&rsquo;s PFAS sampling:</p>

<p><strong>2013 PFAS Sampling: Non-Detectable</strong><br />
The City sampled for PFAS in all wells in the City&rsquo;s nine water stations and hired an independent, certified lab to test for six different PFAS. All results showed PFAS were not present at detectable levels.</p>

<p>The City performed this testing in compliance with the EPA&rsquo;s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule to collect data for substances that may be present in drinking water but are not yet regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>

<p><strong>Late 2020 PFAS Sampling: Low Levels Detected</strong><br />
Although not required by the EPA or Department of Health, the City tested for PFAS again in 2020 in representative wells in each of its nine water production stations using a new EPA method that can reliably detect lower levels of PFAS than the method used in 2013. Low levels of PFAS were detected&mdash;below the EPA&rsquo;s Health Advisory Level at that time.&nbsp;These results were made available to the public through the City&rsquo;s website as the City began more in-depth investigation of potential sources and treatment approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Early 2021 PFAS Sampling: Low Levels Detected</strong><br />
To better understand PFAS levels and potential sources, the City sampled groundwater from all operational wells in February 2021. PFAS were again found at low levels&mdash;below the EPA&rsquo;s Health Advisory Level at that time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Future&nbsp;PFAS Sampling&nbsp;</strong><br />
The Washington State Department of Health&rsquo;s rules became effective on January 1, 2022, with sampling requirements starting in 2023. The rules set State Action Levels for PFAS chemicals at a conservative level at which experts say no adverse effects are expected over a lifetime of drinking the water, even in sensitive populations. The State also requires additional sampling when results are above the State Action Level. The State Action Level does not establish a requirement for PFAS treatment at this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The City is proactively engaging on this issue ahead of the state&#39;s rules and timing for compliance sampling and reporting. Along with proactive testing, research is also underway to better understand the potential source(s) of&nbsp;PFAS&nbsp;in Vancouver&rsquo;s drinking water. <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/pfas-sampling-results">Go to the PFAS Sampling Results webpage to learn more</a>. </p>

<h3><a id="source of the city's water" name="source of the city's water">What is the source of the City&#39;s&nbsp;drinking water?</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/aquifers-our-source-drinking-water" target="_blank">The City of Vancouver gets 100 percent of its drinking water from three distinctly different regional aquifers.</a> Aquifers are an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures, or unconsolidated materials that can contain or transmit groundwater.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To provide drinking water to customers, the City operates and maintains an extensive, interconnected water distribution system includes 11 water stations, 40 wells, 50 booster pumps, and more than 1,000 miles of pipes.</p>

<h3><a id="source of PFAS in the city’s water" name="source of PFAS in the city’s water">What is the source of PFAS in the City&rsquo;s drinking water?</a></h3>

<p>There is currently no apparent or known source for PFAS in the City&#39;s water supply. PFAS are widespread in the environment throughout the country and the world. Typically, PFAS can be found most predominately at military bases, manufacturing plants, and airfields that use PFAS. These types of locations historically used products with PFAS. The City has hired expert water quality engineers and scientists to conduct a study to better understand possible sources and concentration of the PFAS in the City&#39;s groundwater supply. The City is also identifying treatment technologies that can be used to remove PFAS and working to estimate the cost to design, build and operate them.&nbsp;The City will continue to update this webpage as more is learned. </p>

<h3><a id="water protections" name="water protections">What is the City doing to protect our source of drinking water?</a></h3>

<p>The City&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/water-resources-protection-program">Water Resources Protection Ordinance</a> has&nbsp;established standards that help protect the critical aquifers underlying the entire city. This ordinance also sets strict standards for compliance by businesses and industries that manage hazardous materials and created Special Protection Areas around the City&rsquo;s water stations as an additional safeguard. The City&rsquo;s Water Resources Protection Program offers technical assistance, education, and outreach to protect our community&rsquo;s vital water resources and our community. Studies are also underway to identify potential sources of PFAS and potential treatment technologies.</p>

<h3><a id="share information" name="share information">How will the City share information with the public?</a></h3>

<p>The City is committed to keeping the community informed. Timely information and PFAS sampling results will be posted on this City webpage. The <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/waterqualityreport">annual Water Quality Report</a> is another way you can learn about the quality of the City&rsquo;s water and PFAS updates.</p>

<h3><a id="What must water providers do" name="What must water providers do">What must water providers do to inform the public?</a></h3>

<p>The Washington State Department of Health&rsquo;s new PFAS regulations require the City to complete compliance sampling using state protocols starting in 2023.The schedule for compliance sampling will be determined by the Department of Health. If the results of the compliance sampling exceed the State Action Level, the City is required to provide public notice as soon as possible and no less than 30 days after the occurrence is identified. If sampling results continue to exceed the State Action Level, then notice must be provided every three months as long as that continues.</p>
