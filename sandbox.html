<h3>Root Up &amp; Out at Marine Park</h3>

<p>Volunteer with City staff from Urban Forestry, Volunteer Programs, Solid Waste, and the Water Resources Education Center on Martin Luther King Day to remove invasive English ivy at Marine Park. Join the volunteer team from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday, Jan. 16, give back to your community and celebrate MLK Day. This ivy pull will be followed by a short educational nature walk through the riparian bottomland forests of the park where we will learn more about our sensitive native ecosystems and the role of non-native species on our urban landscapes.</p>

<p>English ivy is a Class C unregulated weed in Washington State, meaning that its removal is of low priority to land managers due to its widespread presence on the landscape. Volunteers just like you can make an incredible impact on our urban ecosystems by managing the spread of English ivy.</p>

<p>Marine Park needs you! English ivy is still becoming established in the park, and by pulling juvenile vines we have the opportunity to limit its spread and support the continued recovery of the native forest understory.</p>

<p>Event will happen rain or shine! Training, gloves, tools, and a hot lunch will be provided. Ivy pulling will take place primarily off established trails, and the terrain may be uneven. Activities will include cutting ivy off tree trunks, bending over to pull ivy from the soil, and spreading bark mulch.</p>
