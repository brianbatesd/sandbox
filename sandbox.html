<h2>Governor Inslee visits Vancouver to discuss homelessness, housing, economic development</h2>

<p>Ongoing issues with affordable housing, homelessness and inflation&mdash;and their impact on livability in our city&mdash;are topics that are top-of-mind for many in our community. They&rsquo;re also among the topics that brought Washington Governor Jay Inslee to Vancouver Monday, Oct. 31. Joined by his wife, First Spouse Trudi Inslee, the Governor spent time touring some of the City&rsquo;s ongoing projects aimed at addressing those matters.</p>

<h3>Touring a Safe Stay Community</h3>

<p>Governor Inslee began his visit by touring the City&rsquo;s Safe Stay Community at 11400 NE 51st Circle, unofficially dubbed &ldquo;The Outpost&rdquo; by those living there. Financed in large part by the City&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Fund, <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cmo/page/safe-stay-community#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Vancouver's%20first,in%20the%20North%20Image%20neighborhood.">Vancouver&rsquo;s Safe Stay Community program</a> is continuing its positive trajectory. These are not homeless camps. They are secured, fenced communities managed by service providers 24 hours per day, seven days a week, and they are working. Since our first site opened last December, more than 30 other jurisdictions and agencies have reached out to learn more about our program and how we&rsquo;re making it effective.</p>

<p>The Governor had in-depth conversations with both staff and residents at The Outpost. Among those he visited with was a man named Tory, a former addict who&rsquo;s now sober and looking to move into an apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got kind of emotional saying it&rsquo;s saving his life. When you&rsquo;re saving lives that&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; Governor Inslee said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very successful model and everybody&rsquo;s pleased with what&rsquo;s going on here, including residents who really want to change their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Outpost was the first to open of Vancouver&rsquo;s two Safe Stay Communities now operating. Both are proving the effectiveness of this model for addressing the needs of the unsheltered homeless in our community, with at least 25 people having transitioned from The Outpost into housing in 10 months&mdash;with more coming soon&mdash;at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for everyone and we&rsquo;re very impressed with these facilities,&rdquo; the Governor said. &ldquo;Walla Walla keeps crowing about the &lsquo;Walla Walla Way&rsquo;. We need to start talking about the Vancouver Way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The City is in the process of working to open a <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/ssc3">third Safe Stay Community</a>. In October, we conducted extensive community outreach regarding the City&rsquo;s proposed site at 415 W 11th St. downtown. Stakeholder outreach for the third proposed site began even before City Council approved a license agreement with the property owner in September. After the public comment period closed October 28, City staff went to work processing the feedback and using it to inform their recommendations for the proposed site. Those recommendations will be shared at the City Council meeting on November 7. Should Council approve the proposed site, the City will work to have it open before the end of the year.</p>

<h3>A Gubernatorial visit to Fourth Plain Community Commons</h3>

<p>Late last year, Governor Inslee proposed earmarking $800 million in 2022 to create more permanent, affordable and transitional housing throughout the state. To learn more about similar initiatives in our City, he also visited <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cdd/page/fourth-plain-community-commons">Fourth Plain Community Commons</a>, a mixed-use project located along Fourth Plain Boulevard (2200 Norris Rd.) that includes 106 units of affordable housing on the upper floors and a flexible community-serving space on the ground floor. The model development is a collaboration between the Vancouver Housing Authority and the City. We awarded $1.5 million towards the project from our <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/ahf">Affordable Housing Fund.</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very impressed with what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Governor Inslee said. &ldquo;Fundamentally, we don&rsquo;t have enough housing so building more housing is a really high priority for us. We also need to change some of our zoning laws so that we can build more affordable housing in urban areas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before leaving Vancouver, the Governor held a round table meeting with City staff and other stakeholders to exchange thoughts, ideas and goals for current and future affordable housing and economic development initiatives.</p>

<p>I am grateful the Governor and his wife for taking the time to both acknowledge&mdash;and learn more about&mdash;the ongoing positive work we&rsquo;re doing to improve livability for all in our city.</p>
