<h2>Mulching and Weeding at The Downs</h2>

<p>Get ready to break a sweat and restore some soils at The Downs Neighborhood Park! The <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cmo/page/naturespaces">Naturespaces Program</a> is going to be spreading wood chips at The Downs to help suppress weeds, build soils, and get our baby plants through the summer! Adding wood chips to the landscape bed will support this park&#39;s health all year long, even during hot summers, and provide park neighbors with new native plants to enjoy.</p>

<p>Gloves, water, and snacks will be provided. Please bring a reusable water bottle and your own gloves or tools if you would like to. Long pants and closed-toed shoes are required.</p>
