<p>Update as of 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The City of Vancouver continues to respond to the ongoing snowstorm and encourages residents to stay off the roads for their safety and to keep them clear for emergency response and snowplows. </p>

<p><strong>Plowing Priorities</strong></p>

<p>The City&rsquo;s plowing priorities are the streets that enable police, fire and emergency medical service response. Due to these demands, limited resources, and difficulties posed by multiple driveways and parked cars, neighborhood residential streets are not plowed or deiced. A <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/public_works/page/14492/cityofvancouverwa-snow_route_map-winter17-18.pdf">street prioritization map</a> is available for viewing.</p>
