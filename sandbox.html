<h2>Mulching and Weeding at The Downs</h2>

<p>Get ready to break a sweat and restore some soils at The Downs Neighborhood Park! The <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cmo/page/naturespaces">Naturespaces Program</a> is going to be spreading wood chips at The Downs. Adding wood chips to the landscape bed will support this park&#39;s health all year long, even during hot summers, and provide park neighbors with new flowers and greenery to enjoy.</p>

<p>Later in the day, visit us at the Downs Park for <a href="https://www.fourthplainforward.org/arte">Art in the Park</a> with <a href="https://www.fourthplainforward.org/">Fourth Plain Forward</a>.</p>
