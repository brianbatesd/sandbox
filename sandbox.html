<h2>Tower Mall Demolition</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/imageattachments/community_development/page/81824/tower-mall-demolition_areas_map-web.jpg"><img class="image-right" src="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/imageattachments/community_development/page/81824/tower-mall-demolition_areas_map-web.jpg"></a>To prepare the way for new development in the Heights District, the City of Vancouver initiated the demolition of the vacant Tower Mall building and the adjacent Allstate/Bank of America building.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Vancouver City Council approved a contract with 3 Kings Environmental to perform the work. Between October 2021 and April 2022, 3 Kings completed the demolition of the buildings within the Tower Mall site. The process included abatement of any hazardous materials, such as asbestos, in full compliance with all health, safety and disposal regulations, as well as salvaging of timber, piping, metal and other materials.</p>

<p>The vacated site will be used for a variety of interim activities, including special events for the community and city residents until new development starts in a few years. While the site is vacant, the City of Vancouver will control access to the property and monitor the site to ensure that unauthorized activities do not occur.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Design</h2>

<p>With demolition of the Tower Mall complete, we are entering the next phase of work on the Heights District development. During this phase, the City of Vancouver is working with First Forty Feet, a multi-disciplinary urban design firm to complete the design of the streets, parks and other spaces in the district. This work will last through early 2023 and will be timed to allow the City to make the necessary investments in infrastructure to support the early private development in the district.</p>

<p>Early work by our consultant team included land surveys, site assessments and environmental analyses to lay the foundation for future activities. Over the remainder of 2022, the consultants and City staff will draft detailed designs for a new city park and civic space, as well as a range of new intersections and street improvements. All design work will be shared with the public through community forums and communications, with multiple opportunities for community input prior to finalizing the designs for these critical new assets.</p>

<h2>Equitable Development Strategy</h2>

<p>In addition to the infrastructure design work, the City of Vancouver is working with EcoNorthwest, a Pacific Northwest based consulting firm specializing in economic analysis and strategy consulting to help create an action plan for ensuring that new development benefits local residents and businesses. EcoNorthwest will assist the City in identifying models from throughout the U.S. that have created wealth, economic opportunity and access for local residents while minimizing displacement. This strategy builds on <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cdd/page/reside-vancouver-anti-displacement-strategy">Reside Vancouver</a>, a citywide anti-displacement plan developed in 2019, and is being prepared in advance of development occurring within the district so that all new investment advances the outcomes outlined in the Heights District Plan. The strategy is expected to be completed by early 2023 and will involve significant outreach to local organizations and stakeholders.</p>
