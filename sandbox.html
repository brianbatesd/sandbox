<p>The Vancouver Strategic Plan lays out the City&rsquo;s direction for the next six years and beyond. Our city is at an inflection point. We face many challenges, some local and others societal. We also have boundless opportunities to reshape our community in ways that make it more equitable, safe and climate friendly. Vancouver is a city on the rise, within the region and the state. This plan will ensure that we preserve the unique traits that led us all to this place, while we continue to grow and evolve as a community.</p>

<h2>Why do we need a Strategic Plan?</h2>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s Strategic Plan helps the City understand what to prioritize and invest in. The Plan provides a roadmap to help the City Council and staff to understand what is important to the community and reflects their values, hopes, and dreams for the future. A Strategic Plan also ensures alignment between future policies, programs, and investments and the core values and focus areas of the Strategic Plan.</p>

<h2>How we got here</h2>

<p>In June 2023, the City Council approved Vancouver&rsquo;s 2023-2029 Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan is built on core values and focus areas affirmed by the City Council and work previously completed through A Stronger Vancouver, the 2016-2021 Strategic Plan, and community engagement that included the development of a community vision. From 2020 to 2023, the project team attended Council workshops and retreats, conducted interviews with community-based organizations and partners, convened a 16-person advisory committee, and engaged the public through the visioning process to learn about priorities for the future. The project team also worked closely with City staff to ensure that the proposed strategic outcomes and metrics are realistic and align with other planning efforts.</p>

<h2>Check our progress</h2>

<p>The Strategic Plan uses &ldquo;long-term community indicators&rdquo; and &ldquo;six-year performance measures&rdquo; to measure progress. A long-term community indicator is a major aspect of community condition that is tracked over time but may not be directly connected to specific city services. A performance measure is a department or program level measurement aligned with a Focus Area. It measures the City&rsquo;s part of achieving the strategic outcome.</p>

<p>A dashboard is under development, it will be available on the City&rsquo;s Open Data Hub in 2024.</p>

<h2>Core values</h2>

<p>In 2021, Council identified five core values for Vancouver: livability, equity and inclusion, innovation, sustainability and resiliency, and community trust and relationships. The core values guide a vision for engaging with the public and help re-imagine City structures, practices, and policies.</p>
