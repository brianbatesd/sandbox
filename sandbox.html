<p>Annexation is the process by which cities extend their municipal services, regulations, voting privileges and taxing authority to new territory. The City of Vancouver&rsquo;s Annexation Blueprint Plan (2007) identifies urbanized areas within the Vancouver Urban Growth Area and outlines a timeline for annexation.</p>

<p>The City strives to build strong, positive relationships with the community and urban service providers, and facilitate a smooth transition of land from the unincorporated urban growth area into the City. Please see the link below for more information on the Annexation Blueprint Plan, Annexation FAQs, and the Annexation Analyzer, an online calculator tool that allows you to determine the financial impacts of annexation on a specific property.</p>
