<p><strong>The City of Vancouver is undergoing the process to create updated code standards for fossil fuels facilities. The purpose of these proposed standards is to minimize the risk of spill or discharge of fuels into groundwater sources or waters of the state; to avoid and minimize any impacts to adjacent communities from fire or explosion; to support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a transition to renewable fuel and energy production consistent with Federal, state and local targets; and to protect and preserve fish and wildlife habitat areas to ensure viable Tribal fisheries consistent with Treaty fishing rights.</strong></p>

<h2>Project Background and Moratorium</h2>

<p>In June 2020, City Council enacted a six-month moratorium on new or expanded large-scale fossil fuel facilities, based on concerns about potential impacts to local public and environmental health and safety and to climate change. It has been enacted to allow time to update the land use code standards for such uses and to align them with other planning efforts currently underway, such as the Vancouver Strategic Plan update, Climate Action Plan, and other Title 20 code amendments</p>

<p>The moratorium prohibits new or expanded facilities engaged in distribution, extraction, refinement, processing or bulk movement of fossil fuels, or bulk storage of over two million gallons of fossil fuels. Facilities producing energy from landfill gas, fossil fuel by-products such as asphalt or others, or direct consumer sales such as gas stations, are all explicitly exempted from the moratorium. Upkeep, repair, maintenance, or City-mandated health and safety improvements of any existing facilities are also exempted.</p>

<p>The current fossil fuel facility moratorium follows a narrower crude oil facility moratorium and subsequent update to zoning code standards adopted in 2014. That moratorium and zoning prohibition was spurred by a proposed large scale crude oil transshipment terminal proposed at the Port of Vancouver in 2013. That facility was ultimately denied by the Governor in 2018 following a unanimous denial recommendation from the state Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC), which is tasked with review of the very largest energy facilities proposed in the state.</p>

<h2>Code Development</h2>

<p>The stated objective of the moratorium is to allow time for staff to propose changes to VMC Title 20, Land Use and Development Code, to regulate bulk fossil uses and for such changes to be adopted by City Council. At various public meetings on the moratorium proposed code changes, Council&rsquo;s direction to staff was to: a) prohibit new large-scale fossil fuel facilities in all zoning districts; provide definitions for regulated fossil fuels and large-scale facilities consistent with moratorium; consider whether expansion of existing large-scale fossil fuel facilities should be allowed and, if so, what standards should apply; and finally, to make the regulations as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, staff has consulted with fossil fuel industry experts, and engaged in a series of meetings with environmental advocates and fuel industry stakeholders including the Port of Vancouver and numerous representatives from several existing bulk fuel facilities, as well as the Planning Commission. Planning staff have tried where possible to incorporate input on specific code language to make the ordinance clearer and to balance the stated objectives of the Council with industry and environmental perspectives.</p>

<h2>SEPA Determination</h2>

<p>Pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and WAC 197-11, the City of Vancouver as lead agency has determined that the proposed Fossil Fuel Code Amendments will not have a probable significant adverse impact on the environment. A Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) was published on August 15, 2022 in the Columbian with a 14-day comment period, which expired on August 30, 2022. Copies were emailed to state and local agencies, media representatives, concerned citizens whose names were on the master SEPA list, stakeholders and neighborhood associations. </p>
