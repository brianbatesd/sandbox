<h2>No, fireworks are NOT legal in the City of Vancouver</h2>

<p>In 2015, the Vancouver City Council approved a fireworks ordinance (M-4137) that went into effect in October 2016. This ordinance made the sale and use of consumer fireworks inside the city limits of Vancouver a crime. This is a complete ban that includes all types of fireworks.</p>

<p>Civil fines start at $500 for violating this law.</p>

<p>To assist citizens in complying with the law, Vancouver Fire Marshal Heidi Scarpelli is encouraging people to visit the&nbsp;<a href="/node/14484"><strong>City Limits map</strong></a> to determine if they are inside or outside the city limits of Vancouver. Just because your mailing address is &quot;Vancouver, WA&quot; does not mean you are actually located within the city limits.</p>

<p>If you live outside the Vancouver city limits, other regulations apply. Please be guided by that jurisdiction&#39;s applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>To record a complaint related to 4th of July activities in Clark County, please call (360) 597-7888.</strong></p>

<p>You will need to provide the address or nearest cross streets of the location where the fireworks are being discharged when you call.</p>

<p>If you observe the following <strong><em>extreme circumstances</em>,</strong> you should call 9-1-1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fireworks are causing an active fire</li>
<li>Fireworks are being discharged in a reckless manner</li>
<li>Aerial mortars are being used in any way other than a factory launch tube</li>
