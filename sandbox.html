<p><strong>Small Business Month in Vancouver</strong>: On May 2, 2022, Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle will proclaim the month of May as &ldquo;Small Business Month&rdquo; in Vancouver. The designation coincides with National Small Business Week (May 1-7, 2022). Small businesses are the heart of Vancouver&rsquo;s economy, representing over 95% of our businesses, which contribute to our community by providing jobs, services and amenities. </p>

<p>We recommend supporting Vancouver&#39;s hundreds of small businesses this May and throughout the year. Follow the hashtag #CouveSmallBiz and visit the City of Vancouver on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VancouverUS/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vancouverus/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/vancouverus"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> to watch, learn and stay informed. </p>

<p><strong>Building a Better America Through Entrepreneurship Virtual Summit</strong>: The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is celebrating <a href="https://www.sba.gov/national-small-business-week"><strong>National Small Business Week 2022</strong> </a>(May 1-7) by hosting a multi-day virtual summit that celebrates the resiliency and tenacity of America&rsquo;s entrepreneurs who are doing their part to power our nation&rsquo;s historic economic comeback.</p>

<p>The &quot;<strong>Building a Better America Through Entrepreneurship Virtual Summit</strong>&quot; will share tools and information that entrepreneurs and small businesses need to further power economic growth, strengthen supply chains, and deliver the products and services Americans depend on every day.</p>

<p>The virtual summit takes place May 2-5, 2022, and includes useful sessions for small businesses such as Square&rsquo;s Great Product Photography and Samsung&rsquo;s Empowering a Hybrid Workforce (business and tech best practices).</p>

<p><strong>April 11, 2022</strong></p>

<p><strong>Business License Surcharge (BLS) Fee Refunds Extended for Eligible Businesses: </strong>Local businesses most impacted by continued pandemic-related restrictions will continue to benefit from a program to refund the City&rsquo;s business license surcharge (BLS) fee, an &ldquo;employee fee&rdquo; that is calculated per full time employee. The Vancouver City Council recently approved extending the refund program through the end of 2022. </p>

<p>The program, which launched April 1, 2021 and now will continue through <strong>December 2022</strong>, is an extension of the city&rsquo;s temporary business license fee waiver emergency order approved in April 2020 to provide immediate economic relief to all city business license holders impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>The newly extended refund program is targeted toward businesses that have traditionally served large numbers of customers indoors, simultaneously. These businesses are among those most severely impacted by the pandemic, are likely to remain subject to some of the longest restrictions, and are particularly well-situated to utilize BLS fee savings to support increased consumer safety. Specifically, the businesses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restaurants, taverns, breweries, wineries and distilleries</li>
<li>Fitness and training facilities</li>
<li>Movie theaters, theaters, and performing arts venues</li>
<li>Bowling facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible businesses seeking refunds will be required to first continue with their usual license registration and fee payment process through the Washington State Department of Revenue. Then, those businesses will need to complete a City of Vancouver business license surcharge refund application form to receive the refund. New businesses will need to first apply for a city business license.</p>

<p>A link to the refund application is available at <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/financial_and_management_services/page/38208/covid-19_surcharge_refund_request_form_april_2022_rev.pdf"><strong>www.cityofvancouver.us/CovidSurchargeRefund</strong></a>. If your business meets the eligibility requirements listed, you can request a refund by completing the application form and returning it to the City no later than <strong>January 31, 2023</strong>.</p>

<p>Business owners who have questions about the program may call city licensing staff at 360-487-8410, option 3, or send an email to <a href="mailto:business.licenses@cityofvancouver.us?subject=BLS%20Fee%20Refund">business.licenses@cityofvancouver.us</a>.</p>

When its sister event company, Night Market Vancouver, was forced to temporarily halt all activity due to health and safety concerns in spring 2020, Pop-Local was created to serve as a new home for local vendors &mdash; to showcase their brands and to bring their products to market in a pandemic-friendly way, and without the need for vendors to put up booths.</p>

<p>Pop-Local gives local vendors an opportunity to have a consistent retail presence while streamlining the process for them and supporting product sales. Its new storefront will be a one-stop-shop existing to support and share the stories of independent businesses, artists and artisans local to the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p><strong>Street Eats Program: Outdoor Seating and Parklets Extended</strong>: The City of Vancouver has extended the Street Eats Program that was set to expire March 31, 2021. The extension allows restaurants to keep outdoor seating areas located/constructed in parking spaces in front of their restaurants (parklets) for three years after they are allowed to open at 100% occupancy.</p>

<p>Restaurants will need to start paying for use of the parking spaces, but not until one year after the Governor&rsquo;s restrictions on occupancy are lifted. The program continues to have capacity to support additional parklets in Downtown and Uptown Village areas. At a recent meeting, City Council members noted that parklets add ambiance and street level activity to these areas, while making a minimal impact on the total number of parking spaces being utilized.</p>

<p><strong>May 3, 2021</strong></p>

<p><strong>Business License Surcharge (BLS) Fee Refunds for Eligible Businesses</strong>: Local businesses most impacted by continued pandemic-related restrictions will benefit from a new program to refund the City&rsquo;s business license surcharge (BLS) fee, an &ldquo;employee fee&rdquo; that is calculated per full time employee. The Vancouver City Council approved the refund program during its April 5, 2021 meeting. </p>

<p>The program, which launched April 1 and will continue through March 2022, is an extension of the city&rsquo;s temporary business license fee waiver emergency order approved in April 2020 to provide immediate economic relief to all city business license holders impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The waiver provided $5.5 million in direct support to businesses.</p>

<p>The newly adopted refund program is targeted toward specific industries where ongoing restrictions impact business viability. Surcharge refunds are available to businesses that traditionally serve large numbers of customers indoors, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restaurants, taverns, breweries, wineries and distilleries</li>
<li>Fitness and training facilities</li>
<li>Movie theaters and performing arts venues</li>
<li>Bowling facilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible businesses seeking refunds will be required to first continue with their usual license registration and fee payment process through the <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/manage-business/city-license-endorsements/vancouver">Washington State Department of Revenue</a>. Then, those businesses will need to complete a City of Vancouver business license surcharge refund application form to receive the refund. New businesses will need to first apply for a city business license.</p>

<p>A link to the refund application is available at <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/financial_and_management_services/page/38208/covid-19_surcharge_refund_request_form_20210406.pdf">www.cityofvancouver.us/CovidSurchargeRefund</a>.</p>

<p>Refunds will be returned within approximately 30-45 days, depending on the volume of requests.</p>

<p>Business owners who have questions about the program may call city licensing staff at 360-487-8410, option 3, or send an email to <a href="mailto:business.licenses@cityofvancouver.us">business.licenses@cityofvancouver.us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Plans/Guidance for Re-Opening Businesses</strong>: Governor Inslee recently released the state&rsquo;s Safe Start Washington plan, a four-phase approach to re-opening Washington&rsquo;s economy. <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/safe-start">Phase 1</a> began on May 5, and included reopening retail businesses for curbside pick-up only, auto/RV/boat/ORV sales, landscaping/lawn care businesses, dog walking services and car washes.</p>

<p><a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/safe-start">Phase 2</a> includes reopening restaurants and taverns (&lt;50% capacity and table sizes no larger than 5), in-store retail shopping, real estate, professional services, new construction, hair and nail salons/barbers and housecleaning services.</p>

<p>Note that the Governor&#39;s Office issued a <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19CustomerLogMemo.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">statement</a> that, effective May 15, 2020, customers are no longer required to provide a business with contact information, and businesses should not condition service on a customer&rsquo;s unwillingness to do so. Businesses are still obligated to maintain a customer log of those who voluntarily provide their information.</p>

<p>The soonest Phase 2 will begin in most of the state is early June, provided we have made measurable progress in COVID-19 case reduction, increased testing, contact tracing/investigations, healthcare system readiness, and protections for vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>For further clarification, Clark County Public Health has issued an <strong><a href="https://www.clark.wa.gov/public-health/clark-county-restaurants-can-begin-planning-reopening-dining-areas-must-remain-closed">important message</a></strong> re: the status of Clark County restaurants reopening.</p>
