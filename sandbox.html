<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The McGillivray Boulevard Safety and Mobility Project is exploring ways to make McGillivray Boulevard safer and more comfortable for everyone to travel between SE Chkalov Drive/SE 7th Street and SE 164th Avenue. The Safety and Mobility Project will evaluate how McGillivray Boulevard can better meet the needs of people walking, biking, using a mobility device, and driving. The Project will explore opportunities and examine tradeoffs to improve safety on the corridor ahead of the pavement project planned for 2024.</p>

<h2>Project Background</h2>

<p>The McGillivray Boulevard Safety and Mobility Project is exploring ways to make McGillivray Boulevard safer and more comfortable for everyone traveling between SE Chkalov Drive/SE 7th Street and SE 164th Avenue. This Project is part of a major east-west corridor of the City&rsquo;s transportation network, connecting SE 34<sup>th</sup> Street, McArthur Blvd, and McLoughlin Blvd. This Project will contribute to enhanced pedestrian safety and multimodal safety elements for all users travels across the City.</p>

<h2>Existing Conditions</h2>

<p>The McGillivray Boulevard Safety and Mobility Project will evaluate how McGillivray Boulevard can better meet the needs of people walking, biking, using a mobility device, and driving. Community engagement and analysis of the corridor will help us to understand what the conditions and concerns are for users of the corridor and will help shape the safety and mobility improvements that are recommend and implemented.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>

<h2>Safety Improvements</h2>

<p>The safety improvements for the road will be informed by what we hear from the community during outreach during the Winter of 2022 and Spring of 2023. As we move into Phase 2 and 3 of the project, we&rsquo;ll have more information about specific safety improvements for the corridor.</p>

<h2>Proposed Design Elements</h2>

<p>The design proposals for the road will be informed by what we hear from the community during outreach during the Winter of 2022 and Spring of 2023. As we move into Phase 2 and 3 of the project, we&rsquo;ll have more information about design elements for the corridor.</p>

<h2>Paving</h2>

<p>The McGillivray Blvd project is in partnership with the City&#39;s <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/pavement-management">Pavement Management Program</a>. The City&#39;s Pavement Management Program will perform a re-sealing treatment in 2024 to protect to improve and extend the life of the street.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The McGillivray Boulevard Safety and Mobility Project began in Fall 2022 and is expected to conclude in Fall 2023. The Safety and Mobility Project will include the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1: Analyze the Corridor:</strong> The project team will evaluate how McGillivray Boulevard currently operates and is used by all users and modes by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collecting traffic counts, on-street parking occupancy rates, and collision data along the corridor</li>
<li>Analyzing how safe and comfortable existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities are for people of all ages and abilities and identifying gaps in these facilities</li>
<li>Analyzing delay experienced by drivers at key intersections along the corridor and how long it takes to drive the corridor during morning and evening commute times</li>
<li>Analyzing how easy it is for people to walk, bike, or use other small mobility devices to travel to key destinations along the corridor, including parks and schools</li>
<li>Engaging with key stakeholders and community members to understand how they use corridor to travel and existing barriers to traveling on the corridor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2: Develop Options: </strong>The project team will use information gathered during the first phase of the study to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a framework and set of goals that will be used to align proposed improvements with community needs and desires</li>
<li>Develop a set of options that would make it safer and more comfortable to travel on McGillivray Boulevard</li>
<li>Evaluate using the framework how the options align with the study goals</li>
<li>Evaluate using the framework how the options will change the experience for people driving, biking, walking or using a mobility device on McGillivray Boulevard</li>
<li>Engage with key stakeholders and community members to gather feedback on set of options</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3: Design Improvements:</strong> Based on the feedback gathered during the first two phases of the project, a preferred option will be selected. Following selection of a preferred option, the project team will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share the proposed design with key stakeholders and the community to gather feedback and identify any additional improvements that may be needed to achieve the project goals</li>
<li>Prepare Design Plans to be included with the pavement project</li>
</ul>
