<p>Vancouver, WA &ndash; The Vancouver Police Department is seeking volunteers to join the mission of making Vancouver the safest urban city in Washington. We are currently accepting applications for our next Neighbors On Watch (NOW) training academy which runs April 20 &ndash; May 25. During the 6-week academy, participants will meet once per week and will learn a variety of skills including how to be a good witness, observation skills, CPR and more. Volunteers gain insight and knowledge of crime trends, police priorities, learn from subject matter experts and get to know and work with Vancouver Police Officers. Volunteers must be over 21 years old, live in Vancouver city limits and pass a thorough background investigation. </p>

<p>NOW volunteers participate in highly visible and non-confrontational patrols throughout the city. Volunteers have assisted with assignments including recovery of stolen vehicles, implementation of the Out of State License Plate Program and responding to callouts to help locate missing people and evidence. Volunteers also assist with a variety of administrative projects that support the Backgrounds, Logistics, Training and Traffic Units. Opportunities include outreach event assistance, delivering inter-office mail, and an array of short-term and long-term projects that suit all skills and physical abilities. </p>

<p>Applications for NOW Academy #23 are due by March 13, 2023. For information, contact Vancouver Police Department Volunteer Coordinator Jordan Macfarlane at: <a href="mailto:jordan.macfarlane@cityofvancouver.us">jordan.macfarlane@cityofvancouver.us</a>.</p>
