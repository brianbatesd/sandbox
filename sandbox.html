<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill signed into law on March 11, 2021, to speed up the country&rsquo;s recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to funding COVID-19-related measures and delivering immediate relief to American families, ARPA distributed more than $360 billion in emergency funding for state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments.</p>

<p>The City of Vancouver is receiving approximately $32.6 million in ARPA funding to support the City&rsquo;s efforts to recover from the pandemic-induced economic crisis, which disproportionately impacted socially vulnerable and historically disenfranchised communities. In November 2021, City Council decided to allocate around 75% of this funding to be spent in the Fourth Plain area (between I-5 and I-205) in response to the Fourth Plain community&rsquo;s long-standing economic and health disparities that were made worse by the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>

<p>City staff will be creating a funding strategy rooted in community engagement so the Fourth Plain community can lead the process in determining how this unprecedented investment will be spent. Engagement for the project will happen in two phases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phase 1 will be broadly focused and will include engagement on the community&rsquo;s needs, challenges and vision for the future</li>
<li>Phase 2 will build on previous engagement and will aim to create a prioritized list of specific projects the community wants to see ARPA funding used for</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 1 engagement will begin fall 2022. Stay tuned and sign up for project updates to stay informed about future engagement opportunities.</p>
