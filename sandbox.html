<p class="top">In 2016, the Vancouver City Council adopted the <a href="/node/77261">City&#39;s 2016-2021 Strategic Plan</a>. Action 1.1.1 of the Strategic Plan directs the City to adopt and implement a Complete Streets program which is designed and operated to enable safe mobility for all road users.</p>

<p>In 2017, the City Council adopted a <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/community_development/page/74381/complete_streets_policy_-_ord._exhibit_a.pdf">Complete Streets ordinance (PDF)</a> that set the following vision and intent: a safe, accessible street system that benefits all users, ages, and abilities, regardless of how they choose to travel; a convenient and interconnected transportation network that improves accessibility to adjacent land uses and fits the dynamics and character of each neighborhood throughout the City; and leveraging local funding for complete streets projects with regional, state, and federal grant funding programs.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<p>Using the 2016-2021 Strategic Plan and Complete Streets Policy as a guide, the City initiated several projects to improve the safety and mobility for people walking and biking on several key corridors:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/node/74791">Fourth Plain Boulevardâ€¯and Fort Vancouver Way:</a> Fourth Plain Boulevard, from F Street to Andresen Road, and Fort Vancouver Way from Mill Plain Boulevard to Fourth Plain Boulevard. Phase 1 of the project will include a roadway reconfiguration and apply an asphalt rubber chip seal placed down in 2023. Phase 1 includes Fourth Plain Boulevard from F Street to Fort Vancouver Way, and Fort Vancouver Way from Mill plain to Fourth Plain. The remainder of the corridor will receive treatment in 2024. The pavement projects will provide an opportunity to evaluate potential changes to the street to improve safety, mobility, and accessibility through repurposing a travel lane.</li>
<li><a href="/node/76591">SE 34th Street</a>: SE 34th Street, between SE 164th Avenue and SE 192nd Avenue, will have a microsurfacing treatment in 2023. The pavement project will provide an opportunity to evaluate potential changes to the street to improve safety, mobility, and accessibility and repurposing a travel lane to add bicycle facilities, slow speeding vehicles and increase transit access.</li>
<li>McGillivray Boulevard: The McGillivray Boulevard Safety and Mobility Project is exploring ways to make McGillivray Boulevard safer and more comfortable for everyone to travel between SE Chkalov Drive and SE 164th Avenue. The Safety and Mobility Project will evaluate how McGillivray Boulevard can better meet the needs of people walking, biking, using a mobility device, and driving. The Project will explore opportunities and examine tradeoffs to improve safety on the corridor ahead of the pavement project planned to occur in Summer 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Completed Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="/node/41881">Tech Center Drive</a>: In 2021, the City completed a safety improvement project on SE Tech Center Drive between SE 172nd Avenue and SE Tech Center Place/SE 167th Avenue. The project improves safety and mobility for people using all modes of transportation, increase multimodal access to a major employment center, and fill an important gap in the City&rsquo;s bike network.=</li>
<li><a href="/node/36189">McLoughlin Boulevard</a>: In 2019, the City constructed improvements on McLoughlin Boulevard between Reserve Street and Brandt Road. These improvements included both permanent speed cushions and flashing light intersection crossings. The city did a pilot project with buffered bike lanes and &ldquo;sharrows&rdquo; (shared lane markings).
<ul>
<li>The City planned to evaluate the performance of the pilot project elements from spring 2020 to spring 2021. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project evaluation, and the evaluation is now scheduled for completion in spring of 2023.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/node/37689">Columbia Street Safety and Mobility Project (formerly Westside Bike Mobility Project):</a> In 2021 the City paved Columbia Street from Mill Plain Boulevard to 45th Street, and used a microsurfacing treatment on Columbia Street from Mill Plain Boulevard south to Columbia Way. Then the City installed Mobility Project features for people who bike, walk or use mobility devices to travel the corridor. The City&#39;s Urban Forestry team will be working with residents and businesses to plant new street trees in the winter and spring of 2022-2023 to further improve the corridor.
<ul>
<li>The City will evaluate the performance of the project elements using both community feedback and data collection. These evaluation tools include in-person surveys of people walking and biking on these streets, as well as traffic counts of driver speeds and volumes. It is anticipated that the results of the evaluation will be completed spring of 2023.<br />
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>

<p>As part of the City Council 2021-2022 biennial budget, funds were provided to complete traffic analysis, public outreach, and potential design alternatives for the following projects. The planning process for these streets is in preparation of pavement projects that will be occurring in the corridors in 2023 or 2024.</p>

<ul>
<li>NE 112th Avenue between SE Mill Plain Boulevard and at NE Fourth Plain Boulevard</li>
<li>NE St Johns Road and NE St James Road couplet between SR 500 and NE Minnehaha Street</li>
<li>E 33rd Street and E 29th Street between Main Street and St Johns Boulevard</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal for the projects is to look at ways to improve safety, equity, and mobility for all users, no matter how they choose to travel. Potential options to achieve this goal is look at ways to repurpose a travel lane and/or add safety improvements in the corridors.</p>
