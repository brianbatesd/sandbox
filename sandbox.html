<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Clif Barnes - nominated by Urban Forestry Coordinator, Jessica George</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clif is our tree hero. He is a longtime volunteer in our community and advocate for trees. In 2016 Clif took the Tree Stewards course and quickly began volunteering with Friends of Trees; he has served in every role with them over the years. In 2018 Clif joined the Urban Forestry Commission and just last year was appointed to serve as the vice-chair. His guidance and leadership as a commissioner is only matched by his enthusiasm to plant more trees. Clif walks the talk. He has planted several trees on his property over the years (including many Oregon White Oaks!), encourages others to plant on their properties, and volunteers to plant and prune these trees. Clif, your selfless commitment to our trees and the health of our communities is truly incredible. Thank you!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dan Lincoln - nominated by Volunteer Program Assistant, Chelsea White</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan joined the City as a volunteer in March 2022 with a strong desire to be part of the solution to litter in our community and has since spent over 30 hours beautifying his neighborhood and has removed over 30 bags of trash! When he noticed some other opportunities in his local park, Dan adopted Shumway in June of last year and has already coordinated volunteers to serve over 80 hours, cleaning graffiti, removing dead plants and other organic debris, and maintaining Shumway Park's cleanliness and safety. When Dan noticed the park's dog bag station was empty, he signed up to stock the station to keep the park even cleaner. When Dan sees an issue in the community, instead of complaining about it, he rolls up his sleeves and becomes part of the solution.</p>
