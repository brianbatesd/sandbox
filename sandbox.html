<p>Community Court seeks to reduce and properly address quality of life offenses by utilizing a collaborative, problem-solving approach to crime. Community Court promotes participant accountability while helping them avoid future involvement in the criminal justice system by connecting participants to needed services or treatment.</p>

<h2>Principles of Community Court</h2>

<ul>
<li>Individualized justice</li>
<li>Improve quality of life for participants and the community</li>
<li>Promote fair, equitable and responsive policies</li>
<li>Find family and community-oriented solutions</li>
<li>Expand employment and education opportunities</li>
<li>Community and neighborhood improvement through sustainable environmental awareness and action</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Police officers will cite eligible offenses into Community Court at the next available court date. A prosecutor will screen the citation to ensure the case is appropriate. Example of eligible offenses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Criminal Trespass 2 (RCW 9A.52.080)</li>
<li>Disorderly Conduct (RCW 9A.84.030)</li>
<li>Intoxicating Liquor in the Park (VMC 15.04.120)</li>

<li>Unlawful Transit Conduct (RCW 9.91.025)</li>
<li>Urinating in Public (VMC 7.10.020)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional cases may be referred from the arraignment docket if deemed eligible for Community Court.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s required?</h2>

<p>If you have been cited to appear in Community Court, a court appointed attorney will be available at arraignment to discuss the process, review the police report, and provide advice prior to entering the program.</p>

<p>In addition to work crew assigned directly from the court, you will have a needs assessment, where you will be immediately required to meet and participate with providers to help you navigate services such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Healthcare/insurance</li>
<li>Mental/behavioral health/trauma therapy</li>
<li>Valid identification</li>
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/disability</li>
</ul>

<p>Charges will be dismissed if program conditions are successfully completed. Failure to appear or participate will mean a warrant and the case will return to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; court.</p>

<p>Prosecutors can refer other charges, if necessary, to courts such as Substance Abuse Court, Mental Health Court, and Veteran&rsquo;s Court who can better serve more serious charges and individuals who may need longer term services.</p>

<h2>When is Community Court?</h2>

<p>Community Court is held on Monday at 9:00 a.m. (except on public holidays) at The Recovery Caf&eacute;, 3312 E Fourth Plain Blvd.</p>
