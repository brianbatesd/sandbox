<p>To address the growing need of affordable housing in Vancouver, the <a href="/node/82079">City Council unanimously voted</a> to approve a resolution to submit a ballot measure to voters that, if approved, would replace the City&rsquo;s current Affordable Housing Fund Levy that expires at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>The replacement levy will provide dedicated funding for housing and housing services for people with low and very-low income, including those with disabilities, veterans, seniors, and families with children.</p>

<p>Replacement levy Proposition 3 will be on the ballot for the special election scheduled for Feb. 14, 2023.</p>

<h2>What is the Need for Affordable Housing in Vancouver?</h2>

<p>The need for affordable housing continues to grow in Vancouver. A recent study produced by ECONorthwest for the City, found that an average of 1,600 single and multifamily housing units are built each year but as Vancouver grows, housing stock is not keeping pace with the city&rsquo;s growth. More than 2,500 new units per year would need to be built to close the community&rsquo;s housing gap within 10 years, including 750 affordable housing units for households earning 80 percent or less of area median income.</p>

<h2>What will Proposition 3 Pay For?</h2>

<p>The replacement levy, if approved, is projected to assist 2,500 households with rent assistance and housing services, help 150 households with home ownership, preserve or construct 2,400 affordable units, and support 550 shelter beds over the life of the levy.</p>

<h2>How Much Will Proposition 3 Raise?</h2>

<p>The proposed levy replacement would raise $10 million annually, totaling $100 million over a period of 10 years starting in 2024.</p>

<h2>How Much Will Proposition 3 Cost</h2>

<p>At an estimated rate of $0.30 per $1,000 of assessed value, a home assessed at $500,000 this would be approximately $150 annually for a home valued at $500,000, or $12.50 per month. As the city grows, the levy rate per property goes down.</p>

<h2>Is this a New Tax?</h2>

<p>No, this is a continuation of affordable housing levy funding. The proposed levy would start in 2024, after the existing AHF levy expires at the end of 2023.</p>

<h2>Are there any exemptions for property owners?</h2>

<p>Yes, Washington State law provides two tax benefit programs for senior citizens and individuals who are disabled: property tax exemptions and property tax deferrals.

<h2>What is the Affordable Housing Fund?</h2>

<p>The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) was created in 2016 to invest in projects providing permanently affordable housing to very low-income households. The Fund was established through a voter-approved property tax levy that authorizes the City to collect $6 million per year from 2017 to 2023. The City anticipates committing all $42 million available under the current levy by the end of 2023.</p>

<p>Over the lifetime of the current levy, 1,064 units of affordable housing have been produced or preserved with support from the Affordable Housing Fund, 1,654 households have received rental assistance and services to prevent homelessness, and 405 temporary shelter beds have been created or supported with operating costs, including two Safe Stay Communities that have successfully transitioned unhoused residents to permanent housing. Funding generated in the final year of this levy has been allocated to housing production and preservation as well as ongoing rental assistance programs and temporary shelter for people who are homeless.</p>

<h2>When is the election?</h2>

<p>Proposition 3 is on the special election ballot scheduled for Feb. 14, 2023.</p>

<p>Military and Overseas ballots will be mailed out on January 13 and regular ballots will be mailed out and available in the Elections Office on January 27.
