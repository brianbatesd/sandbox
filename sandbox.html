<p>The 29th and 33rd Streets Safety and Mobility Project is studying how to improve safety and mobility for all people using E. 29th Street between Kauffman Avenue and Neals Lane, and E. 33rd Street between Kauffman Avenue and Grand Boulevard. The Project will evaluate how these streets can better meet the needs of people walking, using a mobility device, biking, accessing transit, and driving. This project is coordinating with pavement work planned for 2025 between the I-5 overpasses and St. Johns Boulevard.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>Sign up for project updates to stay informed about the project and how to get involved. The project team will offer a variety of ways to get involved and provide input, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tabling at community events</li>
    <li>Canvassing within the project area</li>
    <li>Small group presentations</li>
</ul>

<p>More details coming soon!</p>

				<p>The Cty&rsquo;s 2024 <a href="http://www.beheardvancouver.org/tsp">Transportation System Plan</a> identifies these streets as important community connections on the pedestrian and bike and small mobility networks. 29th Street is identified as a Neighborhood Greenway. 33rd Street is identified as a primary pedestrian corridor and calls for mobility lanes (e.g. lanes for bikes, scooters, etc.) from W. Kauffman Avenue and Main Street and protected mobility lanes (lanes with barriers between vehicle and non-vehicel traffic) from Main Street to E. Grand Boulevard.</p>

This can look different for every street depending on land use, community needs, and the context of surrounding neighborhoods. Sometimes a complete corridor might use parallel streets to create a more comfortable experience. Your input will help shape what a complete street looks like for 29th and 33rd Streets.

Public feedback supplements the technical analysis and helps shape a range of potential transportation design options. Project staff will evaluate those options and select a preferred design option that will be presented to the City&lsquo;s Transportation and Mobility Commission for recommendation to the City Manager. The project team will offer a variety of ways to get involved and provide input such as surveys, small group briefings, tabling at community events, and neighborhood canvassing.</p>

				<p>Improving safety and mobility for all modes of transportation benefits everyone, including businesses. Customers and employees can reach you in the way they prefer. Safe, connected pathways for people walking, biking, and using small mobility devices (like scooters) help reduce roadway demand so freight can move efficiently. Complete Streets help create healthy, equitable neighborhoods and attract development opportunities. We will work with individual property and business owners through this process to avoid property and access impacts to the greatest extent possible.</p>
