<p>Explore Pop-Up Arboretums at parks across Vancouver during Arbor Month in April and all summer long. Our parks have a wonderful assortment of trees worthy of being called an arboretum, or a collection of trees. Informational signs are temporarily installed on select trees at two parks each month during the summer months and during Arbor Month. Hone your tree identification skills and learn fun facts about your park trees.</p>
