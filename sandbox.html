<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>In 2021, the City of Vancouver was awarded federal funding through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to help aid COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts. Over the next three years, the City will invest more than $25 million of this funding into central Vancouver neighborhoods near Fourth Plain Boulevard as depicted in the map below. This vibrant, growing community has long-standing economic and health disparities made worse by pandemic-related challenges. Through a community-driven process, the Fourth Plain for All project will identify, prioritize, and begin the implementation of a Fourth Plain neighborhood investment strategy. The Fourth Plain for All strategy will include two main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A list of long-term investment options to be implemented over the next 10 years.</li>
<li>A list of priority projects that can utilize ARPA funding between now and 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Area</h2>

<p>The project area includes the neighborhoods north and south of Fourth Plain Boulevard between I-5 and I-205, including: Rose Village, Central Park, Fourth Plain Village, Maplewood, Meadow Homes, Bagley Downs, Ogden, Van Mall, and Walnut Grove.</p>

<h2>Community Process</h2>

<p>There will be two phases of outreach for the Fourth Plain For All project:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> (February-March 2023): We will have discussions with the community that are focused on understanding the current challenges, needs and hopes of the Fourth Plain community. This input will be used to create a list of potential investment options.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> (May-June 2023): We will take the list of potential investment options back out to the community to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirm that we interpreted input from phase 1 correctly and created investment options that the community would like to see implemented</li>
<li>Invite the community to help prioritize projects and programs that they would like to see implemented using ARPA funding between now and 2026. This input will be used to create the final investment strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)?</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic created dual nationwide crises: a public health crisis combined with an economic crisis. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was passed in 2021 to deliver immediate relief for American workers and families and build a bridge to an equitable economic recovery. One of the ways ARPA provides support to struggling communities is through the distribution of more than $360 billion in emergency funding for state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments.</p>

<p>The City of Vancouver is receiving $32.6 million in funding to help support our efforts to recover from the pandemic-induced economic and housing crisis, which disproportionately impacted socially and economically vulnerable communities and small independent businesses. In addition to the ARPA allocation, additional general funds are being leveraged for a combined $40.6 million in one-time resource allocation to deploy to serve critical needs in the community.</p>
