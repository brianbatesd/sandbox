<p>The sun was shining, music was playing, and the guests and residents were all smiles as they gathered for some BBQ, birthday cake and ice cream at the City&rsquo;s second Safe Stay community on Friday, April 28. It was a moment worthy of celebration &ndash; 12 months to the day since Hope Village (4915 E. Fourth Plain) opened its doors to provide some of the most vulnerable in our community with safe, comfortable shelter and services to exit homelessness.</p>

<p>Today, Hope Village serves 24 residents in its 40 tiny homes. This secured, fenced village is managed 24 hours per day, seven days a week, by non-profit service provider <a href="https://www.liveloveoutreach.com/">Live Love Outreach</a>. From the blossoming garden boxes to the personal d&eacute;cor touches on the front of many modular shelters &ndash; it&rsquo;s obvious Hope Village is inspiring hope in the people who live here. Unlike a homeless camp, residents here have access to transitional housing, trash receptacles and sanitation services, portable toilets and handwashing stations, meeting and office space, kitchen facilities and supportive services provided by local agencies.</p>
