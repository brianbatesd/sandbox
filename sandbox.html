<p>Protecting public health and providing our customers a safe water supply is the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s top priority, and we currently meet all federal and state requirements for water quality testing. On average, we deliver 9.5 billion gallons per year of clean and safe drinking water to more than 270,000 people in a 72-square mile service area.</p>

<p>Vancouver, like many communities in Washington and across the nation, is addressing an emerging issue with per-and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances. In recognition of this, Vancouver proactively tested and reported PFAS levels in 2020. In 2023, the City began a new program of testing and reporting for PFAS in drinking water.</p>

<p>We continue to share information about PFAS so that you can make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>PFAS Overview</h2>

<p>Since the 1940s, PFAS have been used around the world in industry and in consumer products such as food packaging, non-stick cookware, waterproof clothing, stain-resistant fabrics, and firefighting foam. These synthetic chemicals can enter the environment and water supplies from multiple sources and do not break down easily, which is why PFAS are sometimes called &ldquo;forever chemicals.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>City Actions to Protect Water Quality</h2>

<p>The City hired water quality experts to investigate possible sources and the extent of PFAS in the water supply and started work to identify potential treatment options. </p>

<p>Work underway includes: </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Testing the water supply:</strong> Operations staff continue to test and monitor water quality in compliance with state and federal requirements to ensure a safe water supply. </li>
	<li><strong>Evaluating treatment options:</strong> Water quality engineers are evaluating treatment technologies to remove PFAS from the water supply.</li>
	<li><strong>Finding long-term solutions:</strong> Expert scientists are investigating potential sources of PFAS and the extent of PFAS in the local groundwater supply.</li>
	<li><strong>Planning for the future:</strong> Future costs for PFAS treatment are included in the City&rsquo;s long-range capital plans.</li>
	<li><strong>Reducing costs:</strong> The City is pursuing state and federal grants and loans to reduce the impact to ratepayers. </li>
	<li><strong>Sharing information:</strong> Up-to-date information on PFAS and test results are being shared with all customers and the public so you can make informed decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Resources </h2>

<p>The levels of PFAS found in Vancouver&rsquo;s water supply are slightly above recommended limits in state and federal guidance. The recommended limits are based on long-term exposure to PFAS throughout a person&rsquo;s life and represent a conservative level at which no adverse impacts are expected over a lifetime of drinking the water, even in health-sensitive populations.

<p>PFAS are present in many everyday household materials including non-stick cookware, food packaging, clothing, and furniture. Minimizing exposure to PFAS will require ongoing reductions of sources of PFAS in our daily environment. If you are concerned about potential health effects from exposure to PFAS, please contact your doctor or health care professional. </p>

<h2>Evolving Science and Regulations</h2>

<p>There are thousands of types of PFAS, and public health agencies and scientists are still studying how long-term exposure to PFAS may affect people&rsquo;s health. As reported by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), current scientific research suggests that exposure to high levels of certain PFAS may lead to adverse health outcomes. </p>

<p>There is a lot that we do not yet know but as the science evolves so do our drinking water standards. </p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2021, Washington Department of Health adopted new State Action Levels for PFAS in drinking water that set conservative levels at which experts say no adverse effects are expected over a lifetime of drinking the water, even in sensitive populations. The state also requires additional sampling when results are above the State Action Level. The State Action Level does not establish a requirement for PFAS treatment at this time.</li>
	<li>In 2023, EPA proposed a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for six types of PFAS known to occur in drinking water. The proposed rule does not require any action until finalized, but if approved would set enforceable levels of PFAS in drinking water and require public water systems to monitor for these PFAS, notify the public of the levels of these PFAS, and reduce the levels of these PFAS in drinking water if they exceed the proposed standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The City has been proactively engaging on this issue ahead of new federal regulations and the state&#39;s rules and timing for compliance sampling and reporting. Below is a brief history of the City&rsquo;s sampling efforts to better understand potential PFAS impacts. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2013 PFAS Sampling Non-Detectable:</strong><em> </em>The City sampled for PFAS in all wells in our nine water stations and hired an independent, certified lab to test for six different PFAS. All results showed PFAS were not present at detectable levels. The City performed this testing in compliance with EPA&rsquo;s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule to collect data for substances that may be present in drinking water but are not yet regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</li>
	<li><strong>Late 2020 PFAS Sampling Low Levels Detected:</strong><em> </em>Although not required by federal or state standards, the City tested for PFAS in representative wells in each of our nine water stations using a newer EPA method. Low levels of PFAS were detected&mdash;below EPA&rsquo;s Health Advisory Level at that time. These results were made available to the public through the City&rsquo;s website as the City began more in-depth investigation of potential sources and treatment approaches.</li>
	<li><strong>Early 2021 PFAS Sampling Low Levels Detected:</strong><em> </em>To better understand PFAS levels and potential sources, the City sampled groundwater from all operational wells. PFAS were again found at low levels&mdash;below the EPA&rsquo;s Health Advisory Level at that time. </li>
	<li><strong>2023 PFAS Sampling:</strong><em> </em>The City began a new program of quarterly sampling and reporting that meets all federal and state requirements. You can find the latest sampling results on the <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/pfas-sampling-results">PFAS Sample Results</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How will the City share information with the public?</h3>

<p>The City is committed to keeping the community informed. We will continue to share actions the City is taking to keep your water save and provide updates as we learn more about treatment options and receive updates from federal and state authorities. Timely information and PFAS sampling results will be posted at cityofvancouver.us/pfasresults. The annual Water Quality Report is another way you can learn about the quality of the City&rsquo;s water and PFAS updates.</p>
