<h2>Do I Need A Tree Permit?</h2>

<p>To maintain a healthy urban forest and quality of life in Vancouver, the City of Vancouver enforces <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/vmc/584/7391/20770010-purpose">Street Tree</a> and <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/vmc/584/7391/20770010-purpose">Tree Conservation</a> Municipal Codes.</p>

<p>Because it only takes a minute to improperly prune or remove a tree but a lifetime to grow one, it is imperative to protect and preserve mature trees from unnecessary removal or destruction.</p>

<p>Vancouver Municipal Codes ensure that the pressures of urban growth do not unnecessarily diminish our tree canopy. View the <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/public_works/page/47191/doineedatreepermit.pdf">&quot;Do I Need a Tree Permit?&quot; fact sheet (PDF).</a></p>

<p>For all tree work, <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/tree-care-companies-street-tree-worker-license">hire a qualified tree care provider</a> (ISA-certified arborist) to ensure proper care of your valuable assets, to minimize future maintenance needs and costs, and to reduce hazards.</p>

<h2>Street Tree Permits</h2>

<p>Street trees are defined as trees in which the trunk is wholly or partially located within the right-of-way. <strong>According to <a href="https://vancouver.municipal.codes/VMC/12.04">VMC 12.004</a>, a permit is required for planting, major pruning and removal of street trees. </strong><a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/urban-forestry-frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a> about the <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us/vmc?keys=12.004&amp;tid=326">Street Tree Ordinance</a>.</p>
