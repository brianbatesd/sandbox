<h2>What is changing?</h2>

<p>As of April 1, 2023, there are five changes to City business license fees:</p>

<ol>
<li>Income criteria for being exempt from paying all City business license fees will change; businesses that report generating a gross annual income in the city of $2,000 or less will be exempt from all City business license fees.</li>
<li>A new fee category was created for profit businesses that report generating a gross annual income in the city of more than $2,000 through $50,000. This business will be charged a reduced Business License Fee of $50, and no Business License Fee Surcharge (employee fee).</li>
<li>Both the Business License Fee and Business License Fee Surcharge (employee fee) amounts will increase to a $300 Business License Fee and $105 Business License Fee Surcharge (employee fee).</li>
<li>The income criteria for charging the new fees will increase. A for-profit business that reports generating a gross annual income in the city of more than $50,000 will be charged the new Business License Fee plus new Business License Fee Surcharge.</li>
<li>For the purposes of determining the amount of Business License Fee Surcharge (employee fee), the number of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; hours in a 12-month period that is reported by applicant or renewing license holder on a DOR application or renewal form will be divided by 1,664 hours; and the result will be rounded to nearest whole number and multiplied by the surcharge ($105 per calculated employee, as of April 1, 2023). The definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; remains the same and includes pay-rolled employees, owners, managers, partners, and officers that perform work in the city.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Calculating the new employee fee</h3>

<p>The city created a <a href="/node/82436">calculator</a> for estimation of the employee fee part of the city fees, using the new employee fee rate of $105.</p>

<h3>When do I need to pay city fees?</h3>

<p>Any City fees due are paid at the time of application or renewal. <strong>A business with a city business license that expires on April 30, 2023, or later should not renew its City business license until after April 4 to avoid being charged incorrect license fees, and must renew the license by its expiration date to avoid the state late fee.</strong></p>

<h3>How do I pay?</h3>

<p>Any required city license fee payment for a Vancouver business license application or renewal will continue to be processed by the city&#39;s licensing partner, the Washington State Department of Revenue (DOR), Business Licensing Service (BLS) through a business&rsquo;s <a href="https://secure.dor.wa.gov/home/">My DOR account</a>. DOR BLS customer service staff are available for assistance with applications and renewals, at 360-705-6741 or <a href="mailto:bls@dor.wa.gov">bls@dor.wa.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>My business is based outside of Vancouver, do I still need to pay?</h3>

<p>The City of Vancouver requires a City business license be held by each business that has employees that engage in business within the city, <strong>including a business that is located outside the city that has employees working remotely </strong>from home or elsewhere in the City. A description of city business license requirements and fees can be found on the <a href="/node/38208">Business and Special Licenses</a> page.</p>

<h3>Are there fee exemptions?</h3>

<p>Businesses that generate an annual gross income of $2,000 or less in the city will continue to be exempt from all City business license fees. Non-profit organizations and qualifying small businesses will be exempt from the Business License Fee Surcharge (employee fee).</p>
