<p>Starting on April 1, 2023 changes to the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s business license fees will go into effect. </p>

<h3>Why are the license fees changing?</h3>

<p>To respond to community priorities identified in the recently approved 2023-2024 biennial budget, the Vancouver City Council made changes to City business license fees to make investments in increased police services, park playground replacements, new roads, and economic development and job creation programs. </p>

<p>The changes will also reduce the fee burden on the smallest businesses in Vancouver, and those conducting limited business in the city.</p>
