Thank you for completing the street tree permit application. As in most of the Pacific Northwest, the adjacent property owner is responsible for maintenance and removal of street trees in the City of Vancouver. However, adjacent property owners are required to apply for and secure a tree permit from the City before beginning any work.
 
Keep in mind, removal is an option but we try to exhaust all other options first to protect trees from unnecessary removals so that they can continue to provide us benefits such as clean air and water. It takes years to grow a tree and only a day to remove them. If a street tree permit is granted, an approved replacement tree is required.
 
You have provided us with all the information we need at this time. We will follow up on your request and contact you after we have completed a site inspection. We have a backlog of approximately 7-10 business days; the inspection may occur sooner as we batch service requests by location.

Thank you,
City of Vancouver Urban Forestry
