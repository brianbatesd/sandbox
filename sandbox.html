<p>Do you want to help make Vancouver a cleaner community? Join the Litter Stewards as we work to remove litter from all corners of our City. </p>

<p>Volunteers will get an opportunity to work with fellow community members to preserve the natural beauty of Vancouver by eradicating litter from public spaces. Volunteers are encouraged to dress for rain. Sturdy shoes and long pants are required as well as a high-visibility vest.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be meeting in the parking lot of the City&#39;s Operations Center and pick up along General Anderson before turning left on Fourth Plain and heading East until we see the Burnt Bridge Creek Greenway. From there, we&rsquo;ll clean-up the Greenway and then circle back. </p>

<p>Youth under 18 must bring a signed <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/city_manager039s_office/page/2875/citywide_-_minor_volunteer_consent_form_-_americorps.pdf"">minor consent form</a>. Youth under 16 should be accompanied by an adult guardian while volunteering.</p>
