<p>If you or a loved one has suffered personal injury from a violent crime, the Washington State Crime Victim Compensation Program may be able to help.</p>

<p>This program was created to help victims with the many costs associated with violent crime. The program provides financial compensation to crime victims for such expenses as medical bills, loss of financial support, and funeral expenses. The amount we pay is reduced by any public or private insurance payments.</p>

<p>While no amount of compensation can erase the painful memories of violent crime, we hope this program will help in your recovery and ease some of the financial burdens you face.</p>
