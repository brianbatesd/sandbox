<p>Vancouver, Wash. &ndash; The Vancouver City Council will hold its next quarterly Council Community Forum on June 12 at Roosevelt Elementary School, located at 2921 Falk Rd. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. with the forum beginning at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>The forum will focus on housing, an issue that affects everyone in the community. While Vancouver has programs and tools to foster and preserve affordable housing, as Vancouver grows the community&rsquo;s housing stock is not keeping pace with this growth. The forum will provide an opportunity for the community to have a conversation with the Council about their experiences, ideas and hopes for the future of housing in Vancouver. There will be time reserved for the community to bring up issues unrelated to housing. </p>

<p>The format will include a short overview presentation from staff on housing in Vancouver, with much of the time spent in table discussions with individual councilors. </p>

<p>All community members are welcome to attend. If you need interpretation services or accommodations with a disability, please contact the City Manager&#39;s staff at (360) 487-8600 (Voice/TTY 487-8602). Every attempt at reasonable accommodation will be made. Light refreshments and drinks will be available.</p>

<p>This is the second quarterly forum of 2023; the next two forums will be held on September 25 and December 11. Locations and topics will be announced closer to the forum dates. </p>
