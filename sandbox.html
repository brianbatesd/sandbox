<h2>Why a Seattle P.O. Box for payments?</h2>

<p>The local payment processor used by the City of Vancouver since the mid-1990s discontinued its service. After exploring and evaluating options used by other governmental entities and businesses in our area, the City entered into a contract with a Seattle-based company to provide secure, cost-effective service with increased efficiencies, including state-of-the-art technology and same-day processing within 24 hours of receipt. That means payments can be applied to customer accounts one day faster. P.O. Box 35195, Seattle, WA 98124-5195, has been set up specifically for Utility bill payments.</p>
