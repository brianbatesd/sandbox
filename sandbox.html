<p>On May 1, Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle proclaimed&nbsp;the month of May &ldquo;Small Business Month&rdquo; in Vancouver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nationally, more than half of Americans either own or work for a small business, and they create two out of three new jobs in the U.S. each year. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.&nbsp;Locally,&nbsp;95 percent of our businesses are small businesses with 50 or fewer employees. They provide jobs, services and amenities to our community.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;the heart of Vancouver&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During Vancouver&#39;s Small Business Month,&nbsp;the City takes this opportunity to highlight the impact of outstanding entrepreneurs and small business owners, and recognizes that <strong>Small Business Month</strong> is a time for us to celebrate the successes of small business.&nbsp; During May, we&#39;d like to thank our small business owners and employees for their contributions to our City, our economy, and our nation.</p>

<p>Throughout the month, our numerous partner agencies will offer online workshops and programs to assist small businesses, which are featured on the <strong><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/economic_prosperity_and_housing/page/18865/small_business_month_-_may_calendar_of_events.xlsx">City&rsquo;s Small Business Month Calendar</a></strong>.&nbsp; On this calendar, you&#39;ll also find fun, community events&nbsp;and other opportunities for you to support your local business neighbors.</p>

<h2>Connect and Navigate Small Business Resource Fair</h2>

<p>On May 11, the City is partnering with 13 Small Business Providers and the Fort Vancouver Regional Library to host a free&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/economic_prosperity_and_housing/page/18865/va_connect_navigate_2023-small_business_resource_fair_let.pdf">Small Business Resource Fair</a></strong>&nbsp;from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Community Room at the Downtown Vancouver library.&nbsp; Startups and growing businesses can drop in to learn about&nbsp;business assistance agencies that provide free classes, technical training, small business loans&nbsp;and other helpful programs&nbsp;- all in one location.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Read About Our Ongoing Programs</h2>

<p>Small Business Month is just one component of Vancouver&rsquo;s commitment to a thriving business community. The City offers year-round assistance through these business-friendly programs:</p>

<h3>Procurement Program</h3>

<p>The City has some great services that are tailor-made for small or growing businesses.&nbsp; For example, most small business owners are not aware that they can bid on smaller projects, jobs, or contracts with the City of Vancouver.&nbsp; Doing business with the City&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/fms/page/doing-business-city-vancouver-0" title="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/fms/page/doing-business-city-vancouver-0">Procurement Program</a> helps small businesses grow their project pipeline, adding to their bottom line.&nbsp; Hiring local recirculates money spent here 2-4 times more than money spent with a non-local company.&nbsp; Hiring local is not only smart and economical, more importantly, it&#39;s the right thing to do, and helps to&nbsp;ensure that&nbsp;equity is embedded in our city&rsquo;s infrastructure projects.</p>

<h3>Pre-Lease Program</h3>

<p>The City of Vancouver&#39;s <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/eph/page/pre-lease-program">Pre-Lease Program</a> is for business owners who want to lease, buy or renovate a commercial space. &nbsp;Staff from city departments - Health Department, Fire Marshal&#39;s Office, Permitting, Sewer, Land Use Planning, Transportation, Engineering, Building, and others - all meet with the owner and architect in the proposed space for a building walk-through before they invest or sign any contracts for the space. City staff provide expertise, comments, and answer questions. This one-hour meeting offers the business or property owner a full spectrum in understanding what changes and improvements are needed before they invest or sign legal documents, saving them substantial research, meeting time, and potentially unknown investment costs. Owners learn:&nbsp; business type allowed in space based on zoning, current occupancy classification, permitting process for proposed changes, and much more - all in a single site visit in under one hour.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Business Assistance and Funding</h3>

<p>One of the biggest challenges we see with small businesses is access to capital, and having limited bandwidth and limited time to identify or pursue business and technical resources.&nbsp; To help, City staff will shop for federal, local and state grants each week, adding them to the <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/eph/page/business-worker-assistance-those-affected-covid-19" title="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/eph/page/business-worker-assistance-those-affected-covid-19">City&#39;s Business &amp; Worker Assistance</a> public webpage. In addition to this, the City&rsquo;s small business provider partners will offer grants or funding specials, which are also included on the webpage, saving business owners time and research, and providing them with a one-stop-shop to find funding or capital assistance opportunities.</p>
