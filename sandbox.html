<h2>What&#39;s Happening Now</h2>

<p>Please take a look at the <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/112thaveproject">BeHeard page</a> to learn more about the project.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The 112th Avenue Safety and Mobility Project will study opportunities to make travel safer and more comfortable between SE McGillivray Blvd and NE 51st Street, in coordination with upcoming pavement work slated for 2025/2026. The 3.3-mile project corridor is an important north-south connector to several neighborhoods, businesses, schools and other community destinations. The project will look at addressing safety issues and the traveling experience for people on foot, using transit, bicycling, using mobility devices or driving along the corridor.</p>

<p>The project team will create corridor design options that utilize the paving work to implement new striping designs, and will consider complementary safety projects and programs. The team will engage neighbors, businesses, and the wider public throughout the project process.

<h2>Project Area</h2>

<p>The project area extends from SE McGillivray Boulevard to NE 51st Street. 112th Avenue is a major north-south connection for the city east of Interstate I-205. 112th Avenue is an important employment, business and residential corridor. Because of the different land and road uses throughout the 3.3-mile corridor, the strategies used to make the road safer for all users may vary in different areas of the road.</p>

<h2>Existing Conditions</h2>

<p>The 112th Avenue Safety and Mobility Project will evaluate how 112th Avenue can better meet the needs of people walking, biking, using a mobility device, and driving. Community engagement and analysis of the corridor will help us to understand what the conditions and concerns are for users of the corridor and will help shape the safety and mobility improvements that are recommend and implemented.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>

<p>The City of Vancouver department of Transportation is working with the community to shape a safer 112th Avenue. Walk through the project details on the <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/112thaveproject">BeHeard page</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summer 2023 - </strong>We will be gathering community input for the 112th Avenue project to understand the current condition and community needs.<strong>  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Fall 2023- Winter 2024 - </strong>We will be gathering community input for design options for the 112th Avenue project. Please share your thoughts about the project and safety concerns. </li>
<li><strong>Summer 2025 </strong>Community members will be notified about the paving projects coming to 112th Avenue between Fourth Plain and Mill Plain Boulevard. The street will be resurfaced with asphalt rubber chip seal. </li>
<li><strong>Summer 2026</strong> Community members will be notified about the paving projects coming to 112th Avenue between NE 28th Street (Burton Road) to NE 51st Street.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Improvements</h2>

<p>The safety improvements for the road will be informed by what we hear from the community during outreach during the Summer of 2023 and Spring of 2024. As we move into Phase 2 and 3 of the project, we&rsquo;ll have more information about specific safety improvements for the corridor.</p>

<h2>Proposed Design Elements</h2>

<p>The design proposals for the road will be informed by what we hear from the community during outreach during the Summer of 2023 and Spring of 2024. As we move into Phase 2 and 3 of the project, we&rsquo;ll have more information about design elements for the corridor.</p>

<h2>Paving</h2>

<p>The 112th Avenue project is in partnership with the City&#39;s <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/pavement-management">Pavement Management Program</a>. The City&#39;s Pavement Management Program will perform a re-sealing treatment in 2025 to protect to improve and extend the life of the street with an asphalt rubber chip seal.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The 112th Avenue Safety and Mobility Project began in Spring 2023 and is expected to conclude in the Fall of 2024. The Safety and Mobility Project will include the following steps:</p>

<h2>Project Phases</h2>

<h3>1: Analyzing Corridor Issues (2023)</h3>

<p>The first phase of the project will identify and study current travel conditions on the corridor by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collecting traffic speed, traffic volumes, and crash data along the corridor</li>
<li>Collecting transit ridership data</li>
<li>Analyzing the safety and comfort of existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Identify gaps in the network</li>
<li>Analyzing traffic operations including average travel times and intersection delay during commute hours</li>
<li>Evaluating multi-modal access to key destinations along the corridor, including parks and schools</li>
<li>Engaging with key stakeholders and community members to understand how they use corridor today, and what barriers they encounter on the corridor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2: Develop Options (2024)</h3>

<p>The project team will use information gathered during the first phase of the study to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a set of options that would make it safer and more comfortable to travel on 112th Avenue</li>
<li>Develop goals and criteria that will be used to evaluate whether different design options meet identified problems, community goals and values </li>
<li>Evaluate the options using the framework to engage with key stakeholders and community members to gather feedback on the goals, and how the design options perform when evaluated through the framework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3: Design Improvements (2024)</h3>

<p>Informed by community feedback during the first two phases of the project, a preferred option will be selected. Following selection of a preferred option, the project team will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share the proposed design with key stakeholders and the community to gather feedback and identify any additional improvements that may be needed to achieve the project goals</li>
<li>Prepare plans to be implemented with the pavement project, and long-term safety improvement projects to be implemented through capital projects in our Transportation Improvement Plan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4: Implementation (2025 &amp; 2026)</h3>

<p>Include near-term design and striping elements for the corridor paving plan.</p>

<h3>5: Long term Investments (2027 and beyond)</h3>

<p>Future investment in long-term safety improvement projects.</p>
