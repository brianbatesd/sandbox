<h2>Determining employee count for employee fee calculation</h2>

<p>For a new business license, report estimated total hours to be worked in city in coming 12 months by all employees; and for renewing license holders, report total hours worked in city in previous 12 months or 4 quarters by all employees. (See definition of &ldquo;employees&rdquo; below.) Total hours are then divided by 1664 hours, and result is rounded to the nearest whole number to determine employee count for the purpose of employee fee calculation; see examples below. The minimum employee count is one.</p>

<p><strong>Employee count calculation examples.</strong> Example 1: 600 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 0.36, rounded to 1. Example 2: 6000 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 3.6, rounded to 4. Example 3: 75000 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 45.1, rounded to 45.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Employee&rdquo; definition:</strong> Pay-rolled employees, self-employed persons, sole proprietors, owners, managers, and partners that work in city limits.</p>
