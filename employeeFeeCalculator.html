<h2 style="margin-top: 1em;">*Estimating number of employees for employee fee calculation</h2>

<p>As shown above, the employee fee will be $105 per calculated number of employees.  The following information can help provide an estimate of the calculated number of employees and resulting total employee fee part of the fees that will be charged, as of April 1, 2023.</p>

<p>For a new business license, an applicant estimates total hours to be worked in city in coming 12 months by all employees; and for a business license renewal, the license holder determines total hours worked in city in previous 12 months or 4 quarters by all employees. (See definition of &ldquo;employees&rdquo; below.) Total hours are then divided by 1664 hours, and result is rounded to the nearest whole number (but no less than “1”) to determine the number of employees to use in calculating the employee fee; see examples below. As shown, the minimum calculated number of employees is one.</p>

<p><strong>Employee count calculation examples.</strong> Example 1: 600 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 0.36, rounded to 1. Example 2: 6000 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 3.6, rounded to 4. Example 3: 75000 hours divided by 1664 hours equals 45.1, rounded to 45.</p>

<p>The resulting rounded number of employees is multiplied by $105 to determine the total employee fee part of the city business license fees; see Estimated Fee Calculator below.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Employee&rdquo; definition:</strong> Pay-rolled employees, self-employed persons, sole proprietors, owners, managers, and partners that work in city limits.</p>
